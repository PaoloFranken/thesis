# thesis
In this repository the visualization that was created for the thesis of Paolo Franken can be recreated. The irisdataset.py file will do so for the IRIS data set. The fmnistdataset.py file will do so for the Fashion MNIST data set. The section that creates the local imaes is commented out as the images were already created and are now provided in this repository (this will drastically reduce the time for the visualization to be build). Similarly, the reduction factors are already set directly and thus the method that would calculate the appropiate reduction factor is commented out (again to improve the time that is needed to build the visualization). The datasetmaker.py script was the script that was used to create the sub data set of the Fashion MNIST data set.
